# Simple Focus UI Toolkit
A simple [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) file we use to jumpstart our UI design projects. It contains color swatches, type styles, buttons, forms elements, and a grid. We tried to keep all styles fairly generic, with the expectation they will be personalized to match your project.

### Requirements
To view the toolkit as intended you will need two font families, [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans) and [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather). 

### Download

[Download the UI Toolkit](https://github.com/simplefocus/SF-UI-Toolkit/archive/master.zip) and use it on your next project.


### Feedback
This is a work-in-progress and feedback is much appreciated.
